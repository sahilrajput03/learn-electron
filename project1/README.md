**Notes:**

- **❤️ Use script `generate-and-install-on-mac.sh` to build, install and then open the app automatically. (26 October 2025)**
- The inconsistent logs fixing is done by removing listeners on ondestroy in app.svelte and removing listeners in preload/index.ts file before attaching the custom-event listener.

## ❤️ Building

- ❤️In macos you must **build** the app to have the name of the application changed in the dock using `nr build:mac`.
  - ✅ The build is produced at `dist/{productName}-{version}.dmg`
- ⭐️Uninstall app in macOS: [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d4Tq28JC17lFqkoz3lqodACnOlCihFj-MnzNb2Vcqd8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6227jtpwqhic)
- *Others:*
  - To change the name of the app you can set it from `build.productName` in `package.json`.
    - Use of any emoji like 🚀 in `productName` is PROHIBITED, if you use emoji the build process throws error - "Permission denied to create directory for NAME_OF_APP_HERE".

## ❤️ **Todos:**

- Can i made a button to minimise electron app (Refer last message asked to it).
- [x] Switch window to frontend every 1 hour to get feedback on progress.
- TODO: I can minimise or switch back to previous window after giving the feedback using the submit button and only after the response is submitted successfuly.
- TODO: Get feedback on the entire day about my feedback so I can know my psychology of working throughout the day.
