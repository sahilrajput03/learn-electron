- [x] Switch window to frontend every 1 hour to get feedback on progress.
- TODO: I can minimise or switch back to previous window after giving the feedback using the submit button and only after the response is submitted successfuly.

I created this project via below command:

```bash
npm create @quick-start/electron@latest .
